# You have a choice of doing 8 of the following. Task 10 is Mandatory.

## Task 1:
- Initialize a global variable with the value of 7.
- Initialize another global variable with the value of 9.
- Create a function that adds the first and second integer


## Task 2:
- initialize two arrays and store them in Array1 and Array2
- Compare if any value in each array is the same as the other array
- print out the values that are the same between each array and their index in each array

## Task 3;
- Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range spcified by user input
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
Examples:
- 10 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2×5 = 10
- 11 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
- Given range: start = 50 end = 100
- Expected output: Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are: 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97


## Task 4:
- Given an integer , , perform the following conditional actions:
- If  is odd, print Weird
- If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
- If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
- If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird


## Task 5:
- Given a specific input of string type convert the input to camel case
- Example input: "himynameisrussel"
- Sample Output: "HiMyNameIsRussel"

## Task 6:
- Create a function that finds the factorial and the prime numbers of an inputted number


## Task 7
- Given an integer n, and t space-separated integers as input, create a tuple,t , of those n integers. Then compute and print the result of .

## Task 8: 
- Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

## Task 9:
- Write a program to create a function show_student() using the following conditions.
- It should accept the student’s name and GPA and display both.
- If the GPA is missing in the function call then assign default value 0 to GPA

## Task 10:
- Create a 12x12 matrix
- Write a program that can detect duplicate values that occur next to each other in the matrix
- Values found horizontally or vertically are good but values found diagonally are not counted
- Take these values extracted and feed them into a 1 dimensional array.
- Use a nested if statement in a while loop that is running as long as the values are not found and the time of day is between 12:00pm Gulf Pacific Time and 3:25 Gulf Pacific Time.

## Bonus 1:
- Given two strings s and t, create a function to determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Bonus 2:
- Given a string of digits, return the longest substring with alternating odd/even or even/odd digits. If two or more substrings have the same length, return the substring that occurs first.

## Task 3:
Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range spcified by user input 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 

Examples: 
* 10 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2×5 = 10
* 11 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

* Given range: 
start = 50
end = 100

* Expected output:
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97


## Task 4:
